### $setup <timegoal [HH:MM]> <timezone [+/-HH:MM]>

This is probably the only confusing command. Timegoal represents when you want to wake up in 24 hour time (ie 05:00 would be 5am). Timezone represents your offset relative to UTC. For example, IST is +5.30 ahead of UTC, so the timezone would be +05:30. EST would be -05:00 etc. An example of the full command: **$setup 05:00 +05:30**

### $reset

Resets your goal, This will also remove your streak. Once you have reset you will need to use $setup again.

### $leaderboard

View the leaderboard ranked by longest active streak.

### $mystats

View your stats including current streak, current goal, target goal and timezone.
